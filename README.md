## 📖 What This Is About

After watching Anthropic's 16-minute talk on Skills, many developers had the same reaction: *"Isn't this just feeding AI markdown files? What's the big deal?"*

This visualization explains the deeper architecture philosophy behind Skills vs Agents using clear examples and comparisons.

## 🎯 Key Insights

- **It's not about documents** — it's about who makes decisions and who coordinates
- **Multi-Agent = System of Intelligence** — multiple AIs coordinated by your code
- **Skills = Intelligent System** — one AI coordinating itself with multiple capabilities
- Learn when to use which approach through practical examples

## 🍽️ The Restaurant Analogy

The visualization uses a simple restaurant example to illustrate the difference:
- **Multi-Agent**: 4 cooks who only know one task each, communicating through sticky notes
- **Skills**: 1 master chef who handles everything from greeting to serving

## 💬 Discussion

This visualization sparked from a common question: *"Skills are just files, why does this deserve special attention?"*

The answer is about **paradigm shift** — from coordinating multiple AIs to enhancing one AI.
